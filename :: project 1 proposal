project 1 proposal


Submitted for your approval:

I aim to create a small, simple Choose-Your-Own-Adventure game that will allow the user to traverse a rich, creative text-based distopian future.


If all goes according to plan, the finished project will be a playable tutorial that contains user login function to keep track of data such as scores and progress. 

It is my beliefe this project will achieve all the required mandates, as well as a few stretch chellenges, some by your design, others placed by myself.
